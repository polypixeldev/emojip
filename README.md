# EmojIP

IPv4 addresses as emoji! (yeah this is a bit of a weird project, but it was fun!)

The code that the WASM file is generated from is at [my fork of aces](https://github.com/polypixeldev/aces/tree/emojip) - big thanks to [quackduck](https://github.com/quackduck) for making aces which made emojIP possible!
